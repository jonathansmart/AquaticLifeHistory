## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Set examples to \dontrun to avoid elapsed time greater than what is allowed

* Checked potentially misspelt words and links in the DESCRIPTION file. All are correct.

* Added details to the description section of the DESCRIPTION file, including references.

* Used TRUE and FALSE  instead of T and F in package functions

* Added examples  to each function.
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
